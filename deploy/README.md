# Monitoring the service

See [eink-home-display.service](eink-home-display.service) for running it under systemd.

The server answers two questions, on the same port as the image (`server.bind`):

- `GET /healthz`: `200` when the service is working, `503` when it is not. The body is one line:
  `ok`, `starting`, `degraded`, `failing` or `stale: the image is 3 h 0 min old`. Only **stale** is a
  failure: a scheduled render more than `server.stale_grace_seconds` (300) late, or still no image
  that long after start-up. A source being down is shown, but isn't a failed check, because the
  dashboard is still updating.
- `GET /status`: JSON with the state, the image's age and version, the last success and last failure
  (with the error text, cut to one line), the number of failures in a row, how each data source was
  on the last render, the next scheduled render, and the uptime.

```
curl --fail --silent http://localhost:8080/healthz          # exits non-zero when stale
curl --silent http://localhost:8080/status | jq '.state, .sources, .last_failure'
```

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `starting` | No image yet, and the service has only just started |
| `ok` | The image is current and the last render was clean |
| `degraded` | Rendering, but a source is shown from old data or left off (see `sources`) |
| `failing` | The last render failed, but the image isn't old enough to be stale yet |
| `stale` | A scheduled render is long overdue. `/healthz` returns 503 |

For Docker, `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail --silent http://localhost:8080/healthz`. For a plain systemd
unit, a timer that runs the same `curl --fail` and restarts the service on failure is enough; I haven't
tried it, and the unit file here doesn't include one. The endpoints have no authentication, like the
image, and the error text can name the failing source, so keep the port on the LAN.

`/status` keeps its history in memory, so a restart starts it again at `starting`. The sources list is
from the last render that succeeded.
